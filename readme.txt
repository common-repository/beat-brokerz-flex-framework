The Beat Brokerz flex framework allows you to stream and license music from the 
Beat Brokerz music marketplace directly on your own website.

== Description ==

This plugin will deploy a Beat Brokerz flex app to your Wordpress site.

Flex apps allow you to stream, sell, and feature any music from the Beat Brokerz
platform on your Wordpress site. It includes a mobile app interface and widgets
for you to display on your pages.

This plugin loads all of the necessary javascript and other resources specific 
to your flex app into your wordpress site automatically. It also provides a custom 
shortcode that you can use to add flex widgets inline with your post content.

To start, you must create a music app on Beat Brokerz before you configure this plugin. 
The app settings on Beat Brokerz will determine the playlists and other behaviors 
of the app on your site. Once you have an app configured on Beat Brokerz, save your 
app ID to the plugin options which will enable the app on your site.

== Installation ==

1. Log into your Wordpress Admin
2. Click the "Plugins" menu
3. Click "Add New"
4. Click "Upload"
5. Upload the plugin and activate!

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, a new menu link will appear 
in your Wordpress admin titled "BB Flex". Use it to configure your App ID and 
other plugin settings. You must create a flex store app on Beat Brokerz to get 
an App ID. Once you have created an app on Beat Brokerz and saved the App ID 
to your plugin settings page, the flex framework will begin to load 
automatically on your site.
